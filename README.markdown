# Anchor Highlight

Do you want to link directly to an anchor on a web page?

Are you fed up of having to dig around in the page source to find them?

Anchor Highlight is a bookmarklet to highlight all anchors on a page which only have a name attribute i.e. are not actual hyperlinks.

This allows the full URL of the anchor to be easily copied and pasted. Think of the possibilities!
